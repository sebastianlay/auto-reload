# Auto Reload

Auto Reload is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) that automatically reloads open files when they are changed outside of the editor. This can be useful for following log files, especially in combination with the [Auto Scroll](https://github.com/PejmanNik/vscode-autoScroll) extension.
