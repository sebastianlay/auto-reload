# Auto Reload

Auto Reload is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) that automatically monitors open files and reloads them when they are changed outside of the editor. This can be useful for watching and following log files, especially in combination with the [Auto Scroll](https://github.com/PejmanNik/vscode-autoScroll) extension.
